# Based on your analysis, what are major insights you learned about movie trends, popular genres, or movie ratings?

# 1. Budget and Revenue Correlation:
There is a strong positive correlation (0.67) between budget and revenue, indicating that movies with higher budgets tend to generate more revenue. This suggests that investing more in movie production is likely to lead to higher financial returns. However, it is important to note that while a higher budget increases the chances of higher revenue, it does not guarantee success. Some high-budget films may still fail to generate expected returns, and there are mid-budget films that perform better than anticipated.

# 2. Consistent Movie Ratings Over Time:
From 1980 to 2020, the average IMDB ratings have remained relatively consistent, showing that movie quality, as measured by user ratings, has not drastically changed over time. However, there has been a slight decline after 2020, which could be attributed to shifting audience expectations, a decrease in movie-going experiences due to external factors (such as the pandemic), or a change in the types of content being produced. This trend suggests that while movie quality has remained stable, audience preferences and expectations are evolving.

# 3. Genre-Specific Trends in Budget and Ratings:
Certain genres like Fantasy, Drama, and Crime tend to receive higher average ratings, while Action movies often have lower budgets compared to Comedy and Drama films. This shows that more dramatic or fantasy-driven films may receive better audience ratings, possibly due to stronger narratives or unique storytelling. In contrast, Action films often have lower production costs but can still generate significant box-office returns, showing that action-based content might be more accessible or widely popular despite its lower production costs.

# 4. Seasonal Release Trends and Scores: 
Movies released during summer or the holiday season tend to have higher box office earnings and audience ratings. These periods are strategically chosen for blockbuster films that cater to family and mass audiences.
